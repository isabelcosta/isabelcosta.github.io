I enjoy giving back to the community by helping people get started with <strong>Open Source</strong> and in tech through <strong>mentorship</strong>.</p><p>I&rsquo;m currently working as a Software Engineer at Globality in the UK. I&rsquo;m focused on backend engineering. Previously, I worked as a full-stack and android developer.</p><p>I volunteer as a mentor for <a href=https://blackcodher.com/>Black CodHer</a> coding bootcamp and <a href=https://raparigasdocodigo.pt/>As Raparigas de Código</a>.</p><p>Previously, I was an admin at <a href=https://github.com/anitab-org>AnitaB.org Open Source</a> community and a <a href=https://stars.github.com/>GitHub Star</a>. I maintained its projects including both backend and android repositories of the Mentorship System. What I’ve enjoyed the most about being a maintainer was managing the project contributions and, at the same time, guiding newcomers making their first contribution to open source, while providing a safe environment for them to learn, with help from the community.</p><p>Occasionally, I write <a href=/posts/>blog posts</a> ✍🏾 and <a href=/talks/>present talks</a> 🎙️. I also do other <a href=/posts/my-volunteering>volunteer work</a> 👐🏾 via mostly mentoring.</p><p>🎲 If I could share something, that I think does good for the world, it would be <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/SpecialBooksbySpecialKids/about>Special Books by Special Kids</a> youtube channel.</p><p>✉️ Want to reach out to me?
