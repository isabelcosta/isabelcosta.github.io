I enjoy giving back to the community by helping people get started with <strong>Open Source</strong> and in tech through <strong>mentorship</strong>.</p><p>I&rsquo;m currently working as a Software Engineer at Globality in the UK. I&rsquo;m focused on backend engineering. Previously, I did a little bit of full stack, backend, and android development.</p><p>I volunteer as a mentor for <a href=https://blackcodher.com/>Black CodHer</a> coding bootcamp and <a href=https://raparigasdocodigo.pt/>As Raparigas de Código</a>.</p><p>I’m also an admin at <a href=https://github.com/anitab-org>AnitaB.org Open Source</a> community and a <a href=https://stars.github.com/>GitHub Star</a>. I help maintain its projects including both backend and android repositories of the Mentorship System. What I’ve been enjoying the most about being a maintainer is to manage the project contributions and, at the same time, help newcomers making their first contribution to open source, while providing a safe environment for them to learn, with the help from the community.</p><p>Occasionally, I write blog <a href=/posts/>~/posts</a> ✍🏾 and present <a href=/talks/>~/talks</a> 🎙️, mostly about Open Source. I also do other volunteer <a href=/work/>~/work</a> 👐🏾 via mostly mentoring.</p><p>🎲 If I could share something, that I think does good for the world, it would be <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/SpecialBooksbySpecialKids/about>Special Books by Special Kids</a> youtube channel.</p><p>✉️ Want to reach out to me?
