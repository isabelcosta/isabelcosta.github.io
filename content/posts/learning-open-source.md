type: note

This is a list of interesting resources to learn about the Open Source ecosystem/landscape. Aside from learning how to contribute, there is a lot about the ecosystem that can be interesting to know, such as how maintainers maintain their projects, how maintainers get paid, how projects can get supported, how corporations can influence the ecosystem, etc.

I'll update as I think of more resources.
