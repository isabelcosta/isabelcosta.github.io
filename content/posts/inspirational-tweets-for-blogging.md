These are some motivational tweets I saved to motivate me to blog and ease up my insecurities about blogging. Hope this helps other newbies at blogging!

I was inspired to share this because of the [#CNC2018](https://2018.codenewbie.org/) Blog More challenge from [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/).

#### Una Kravets

What [Una Kravets](https://medium.com/u/a6dfab4de95e) say here really resonates with me because when I took notes at school, I really would come to appreciate it during the phase of exams and tests.

#### Craig Russell

I really needed to see this tweet! At first, I would get really concerned if an idea I had for a post was already out there on the internet. That would really make me give up writing the blog post. Despite my feeling, when I look at this thread I feel much better, because what [Craig Russell](https://medium.com/u/e70c655d45e1) says makes sense to me.

#### Shubheksha

This is an awesome thread about the insecurity of having to know everything, and the reach for the perfect blog post, that can cause you to never publish a drafted post. [Shubheksha](https://medium.com/u/c98f56800747) gets really candid about this and really helps me to overcome the fear of publishing posts.

#### Christina Lee

This one reminds me that you can learn a lot from blogging, the research for the blog post topic, and the willingness to have a good blog post makes you learn more about the topic. As [Christina Lee](https://medium.com/u/72bd5082d8aa) says, this also applies for public speaking.

For now this are the tweets that I saved regarding blogging motivation. If I see others that might help, I’ll add here.

Share this with anyone that might be one motivational tweet away of starting or blog more.
