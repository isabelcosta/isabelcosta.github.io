### Mentorship System

This is a project I proposed for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program that I participated on **2018**. I've maintained this open source project since summer 2018 until beginning 2022.

This summer I was a Google Summer of Code Student with [Systers Community](https://github.com/systers) (later rebranded to [AnitaB.org Open Source](https://github.com/anitab-org)). I proposed [Mentorship System](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6592097335377920/), a mentorship application to help women in tech mentor each other, on career development topics, during a certain period of time. I worked with mentors, the Systers Open Source community.

I started with the Backend REST API development, using python and flask. After 2 months designing and implementing the backend I started implementing the Android application with Kotlin.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack and tools:** Kotlin, Python, Flask, git, GitHub, SQLAlchemy, Swagger UI, Android

### PREMIUM - Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware (MSc Thesis)

I developed my MSc thesis "PREMIUM: Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware" in the context of the [SafeCloud](https://www.safecloud-project.eu/) project, within the Distributed Systems research group of [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/). The prototype combines multipath communication and route monitoring to react to hijacking attacks.

To develop the prototype for my thesis, I collaborated with two previous MSc thesis projects: MACHETE, a multipath communication mechanism, and Darshana, a route hijacking detection system. I refactored and updated both projects, addressing bugs and implementing new features as needed for my Dissertation project. Additionally, I thoroughly documented critical aspects of these projects and provided clear instructions for their usage.

Leveraging the modified versions of these prototypes, I developed new modules to integrate them and build a middleware capable of detecting ongoing connection path hijacks and shutting down the attack by terminating all communication paths. I also explored other solutions to address compromised paths, ensuring that the prototype was as robust and effective as possible.

üíª **Code** is available at [inesc-id/Premium](https://github.com/inesc-id/Premium) on GitHub.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech stack and tools:** C, Java, Python, VirtualBox, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), git, GitHub, Linux (Debian)

### Smart Home Android app

The Smart Home project was developed as part of my MSc degree coursework in Ambient Intelligence, spanning from February to May 2017. As part of the course, I was given the freedom to choose any idea related to intelligent environments for the main project. I decided to develop an Android application optimized for tablets to manage intelligent devices within a household.

My goal was to create an application that would be easy to use and accessible to people of all ages, including the elderly. To achieve this, I designed a simple interface that would allow users to easily control home devices with minimal effort.

I developed planned and designed all the features. I used Model View Presenter architecture on the android app. I also implemented a very simple REST API using java.

üíª **Code** and user interface designs can be found at [isabelcosta/smart-home-project](https://github.com/isabelcosta/smart-home-project) GitHub repository.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack and tools:** Java, Android, git, GitHub

### MoviesApp

MoviesApp was the project I used to to practice my Kotlin knowledge within the Android development context, back in **2017**. This app simply displayed movies fetched from [MoviesDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) in a grid view (2 columns). I use Model View Presenter (MVP) architecture.

üíª **Code** can be found at [isabelcosta/MoviesApp](https://github.com/isabelcosta/MoviesApp) GitHub repository.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack and tools:** Kotlin, Android, git, GitHub, Retrofit
