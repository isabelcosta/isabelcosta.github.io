### Mentorship System

This is a project I proposed for Google Summer of Code program that I participated on 2018. I am maintaining and managing the project at the moment.

This summer I was a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) Student with [Systers Community](https://github.com/systers). I proposed [Mentorship System](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6592097335377920/), a mentorship application to help women in tech mentor each other, on career development topics, during a certain period of time. I worked with mentors, the Systers Open Source community.

I started with the Backend REST API development, using python and flask. After 2 months designing and implementing the backend I started implementing the Android application with Kotlin.

Repositories on GitHub:
- Backend application: [anitab-org/mentorship-backend](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-backend);
- Android application: [anitab-org/mentorship-android](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-android).

I documented my journey with 1 blog per week on [Isabel Costa GSoC Medium publication](https://medium.com/isabel-costa-gsoc).

**Tech Stack and tools:** Kotlin, Python, Flask, git, GitHub, SQLAlchemy, Swagger UI, Android

### PREMIUM - Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware (MSc Thesis)

I developed my MSc thesis "PREMIUM: Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware" in the context of the [SafeCloud](https://www.safecloud-project.eu/) project, within the Distributed Systems research group of [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/). The prototype combines multipath communication and route monitoring to react to hijacking attacks.

To develop the prototype for my thesis, I worked with two previous master thesis' projects - MACHETE, a multipath communication mechanism, and Darshana, route hijacking detection system. I refactored these projects, fixed bugs, implemented new features that were needed for my Dissertation project. I also created documentation for these.
I used the modified versions of these prototypes and implemented new modules to integrate them.

Code is available at [inesc-id/Premium](https://github.com/inesc-id/Premium) on GitHub.

**Tech stack and tools:** C, Java, Python, VirtualBox, Google Cloud, git, GitHub, Linux (Debian)

### Smart Home Android app

Smart Home project was developed within the Ambient Intelligence course context (from feb to may 2017). In this course I could pick any idea for the main project, as long as it was related with intelligent environments. So I decided to do an Android application suited for tablet to manage intelligent devices in a house. I wanted this application to be easy to use and accessible to people of all ages, including elderly people. So I tried to design a very simple interface so that someone could easily control home devices.

I developed planned and designed all the features. I used Model View Presenter architecture on the android app. I also implemented a very simple REST API with java.

All code and user interface designs can be found at [isabelcosta/smart-home-project](https://github.com/isabelcosta/smart-home-project) GitHub repository.

**Tech Stack and tools:** Java, Android, git, GitHub

### MoviesApp

MoviesApp was the project I used to to practice my Kotlin knowledge within the Android development context. This app simply displayed movies fetched from [MoviesDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) in a grid view (2 columns). I use Model View Presenter (MVP) architecture.

All code can be found at [isabelcosta/MoviesApp](https://github.com/isabelcosta/MoviesApp) GitHub repository.

**Tech Stack and tools:** Kotlin, Android, git, GitHub, Retrofit
