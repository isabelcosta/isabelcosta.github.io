2018 was a very important year for me! So I wanted to write this post so that I can look back to.

Here‚Äôs a summary of my personal and professional achievements (not in order):

* I started my first full-time job in December!

* I made my first talk in front of a live audience, about "Getting Started with Open Source‚Äù at [GDG Lisbon meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/gdglisbon/events/254345727/) (20th September)!

* I attended [Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org/) in Houston, Texas and was [Systers Open Source](https://github.com/systers) representative at Open Source Day during the event! This was my first time being in America!

* I presented my final MSc thesis and finished my Masters‚Äô degree at [T√©cnico Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt) (same time I finished my part time job of 2 years)!

* I was accepted into the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) with the [Systers community](https://github.com/systers), where I proposed [Mentorship System](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6592097335377920/)! I finished the program being nominated within the community as the Most Outstanding Student.

* I traveled to Berlin with a friend!

* I wrote a lot of blog posts (mainly about GSoC)!

* Met the world of Open Source through GSoC and became a maintainer for the project I proposed!

* I met some incredible people through the year!

* I met some online communities, one of them being [WomenMake](http://womenmake.com), got very inspired by indie hacking and started believing I could build products for others on my own, without having to be VC backed. I just got inspired and continue to be!

* I grew as a person, I evolved, I‚Äôm proud of what I am and how I feel now üå±
