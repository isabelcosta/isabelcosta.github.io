I usually use these static code generators to facilitate the development through using Markdown files, without having to do much frontend work. I am currently using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for this website. I changed recently from [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), mainly because i found this Hugo theme I got obsessed about because of the simplicity of the UI and focus on the content. My previous versions used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and  templates.

These are the different versions of my websites until this current one:
- **1st version:** [Live](http://isabelcosta.github.io/first-personal-website) and on [GitHub](http://github.com/isabelcosta/first-personal-website);
- **2nd version:** [Live](http://isabelcosta.github.io/second-personal-website) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/isabelcosta/second-personal-website);
- **3rd version:** [Live](http://isabelcosta.github.io/third-personal-website) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/isabelcosta/third-personal-website). This uses this [jekyll/minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) template;
- **4th version:** [Live](https://isabelcosta.github.io/fourth-personal-website/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/isabelcosta/fourth-personal-website). It uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and is a fork from https://hylia.website/ template. I really liked using Eleventy, it was the first [SSG](https://jamstack.org/generators/) that I got used to.
- **5th version:** this website right here :) This is using [etch](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/etch/) theme. I really like how this is focused on the content.

Here's the [issue tracker of this website](https://github.com/isabelcosta/isabelcosta.github.io/issues) where you can see my roadmap of issues planned or submit a bug you find there.

This website is deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) via [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
