I usually use these static code generators to facilitate the development through using Markdown files, without having to do much frontend work. I am currently using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for this website. I changed recently from [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), mainly because I found this Hugo theme I got obsessed about because of the simplicity of the UI and focus on the content. My previous versions used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and  templates.

Here's the [issue tracker of this website](https://github.com/isabelcosta/isabelcosta.github.io/issues) where you can see my roadmap of issues planned or submit a bug you find there.

This website is deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) via [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
