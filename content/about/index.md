### Olá 👋🏾

I'm Isabel, a **Software Engineer** from Portugal 🇵🇹. I enjoy giving back to the community by helping people get started with **Open Source** and in tech through **mentorship**.

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk/) in the UK. I'm focused on backend engineering. Previously, I worked as a full-stack and Android developer.

I volunteer as a mentor and instructor at _[As Raparigas de Código](https://raparigasdocodigo.pt/)_ community. Previously, I also had the pleasure of mentoring 4 students from [Black CodHer](https://blackcodher.com/) coding bootcamp.

Previously, I was an admin at [AnitaB.org Open Source](https://github.com/anitab-org) community and a [GitHub Star](https://stars.github.com/). I maintained its projects including both backend and android repositories of the Mentorship System. What I’ve enjoyed the most about being a maintainer was managing the project contributions and, at the same time, guiding newcomers making their first contribution to open source, while providing a safe environment for them to learn, with help from the community.


Occasionally, I write [blog posts](/posts/) ✍🏾  and [present talks](/talks/) 🎙️. I also do other [volunteer work](/posts/my-volunteering) 👐🏾 via mostly mentoring.

🎲 If I could share something, that I think does good for the world, it would be [Special Books by Special Kids](https://www.youtube.com/c/SpecialBooksbySpecialKids/about) youtube channel.
