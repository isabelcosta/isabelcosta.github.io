These do not include tools that I use for development/coding, it is only refers to things related with writing of the Dissertation and notes I take.</p><h3 id=onenote>OneNote</h3><p><a href=https://www.onenote.com/>OneNote</a> is the main tool I use to write all my thoughts related to my thesis, and what is discussed at the meetings with my supervisors. I use the Windows app, because of its simplicity and the few features it has. It opens very quickly on my computer. I use a section for the thesis and then I organize all information (e.g.: notes from the meetings) in pages and subpages for each meeting with my supervisors, and other related stuff.</p><h3 id=texstudio>TeXstudio</h3><p>I use <a href=https://www.latex-project.org/>LaTeX</a> to write my thesis. <a href=https://www.texstudio.org/>TeXstudio</a> is the tool I use to write the document offline. The implementation of latex that I use is <a href=https://miktex.org/>MiKTeX</a>, which I needed to work on TeXstudio. There are other tools useful to write LaTeX documents, which work online and allow real-time collaboration, such as, <a href=https://www.overleaf.com/>Overleaf</a> and <a href=https://www.sharelatex.com/>ShareLatex</a>. When I have to work on a smaller document and need to collaborate in real-time, I tend to use Overleaf.</p><h3 id=mendeley>Mendeley</h3><p>I use <a href=https://www.mendeley.com/>Mendeley</a> to save all papers related to the thesis. I love this tool because I can easily browse specific keywords on all the papers. I also highlight all the important parts from the papers, so that I can review later. As a side note if you’re beginning a Dissertation and want to search for papers, these sites may help you finding them: <a href=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/>IEEE Xplore Digital Library</a>; <a href=https://scholar.google.com/>Google Scholar</a>; <a href=https://dl.acm.org/>ACM Digital Library</a>.</p><h3 id=dropbox>Dropbox</h3><p>I use <a href=https://www.dropbox.com/>Dropbox</a> to share all the versions of the dissertation and project documents. So that my supervisors can track my progress and review my work. I also use <a href=https://www.google.com/drive/>Google Drive</a> to save illustrations, which I create with the next tool, or <a href=https://www.google.com/docs/about/>Google Docs</a> documents that may be shared with others.</p><h3 id=drawio>Draw.io</h3><p>I use <a href=https://www.draw.io/>Draw.io</a> to build diagrams and illustrations to better explain ideas and concepts. I feel this is very easy to use and allows me to create simple diagrams very quickly. I save these diagrams on my <a href=https://www.google.com/drive/>Google Drive</a>.</p><h3 id=github>Github</h3><p>I use <a href=https://github.com/>Github</a> Wiki and Issues features to track my research and document what I learn on topics and projects related to the thesis. This is shared with my supervisors so they can easily access it and give feedback.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright © Isabel Costa</footer></body></html>
