If you want to know more about this you can read the <a href=https://medium.com/isabel-costa-gsoc/intro-to-google-summer-of-code-with-systers-open-source-dbdaa92bd189>introduction to my journey here</a>.</p><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>The Coding Period is where the students are dedicated to coding their projects. This period has 3 phases separated by evaluations.
I and the mentors agreed, during a project weekly meeting on the Community Bonding phase, on the action items for the first 4 weeks, which represent the 1º phase of the Coding Period. These action items were then base for my mentors to create the issues so that I could start developing.</p><h2 id=my-work-items>My work items</h2><p>After defining the main action items for the 1º phase of the coding period, we distributed them among the 4 weeks. This week I had two action items, for the backend development:</p><ul><li>API to register a new User in the system;</li><li>API to send verification email for new Users.</li></ul><h2 id=roadblocks-i-had-during-this-week>Roadblocks I had during this week</h2><p>First I have to explain some roadblocks I faced this week. Aside from the GSoC program, I’m finishing my Master’s thesis this month. Because of this I still had thesis meetings with my supervisors and I had to start preparing for my Dissertation presentation. This took me some time of the week.
Besides this, I’m not used to developing backend, although this is something I wanted to explore. Since the 1º phase of the coding period requires that I develop a version of the backend with <a href=http://flask.pocoo.org/>flask</a>, I had to study this. I started studying in the Community Bonding period but it wasn’t enough, I still had to experiment in sample projects and watch more video tutorials (provided by one of my mentors), which I did this week. This lack of experience with backend slowed down my initial development. On top of this, I had a problem with my PC, which led me to format the PC, taking me a big portion of an entire day.</p><h2 id=what-i-did-this-week>What I did this week</h2><p>Having the roadblocks out of the way, I still managed to do some part of my working items. After learning a bit about how to develop using <a href=http://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io>Flask-RESTPlus</a>, I started developing the base architecture of the backend, by implementing the 1º action item — REST API to register users into the mentorship system. I also coded Users <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete>CRUD</a> operations (e.g.: list, update and delete users). I did this already using SQLAlchemy, with the <a href=http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org>flask-SQLAlchemy</a> extension, which eased a lot of the development. Besides this, I also managed to implement a part of authentication features, with J<a href=https://jwt.io/>SON Web Tokens (JWT)</a>. I did this by using another extension of <a href=http://flask.pocoo.org/>flask</a>, <a href=https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-JWT/>flask-JWT</a>.</p><h2 id=development-and-technologies-i-used>Development and technologies I used</h2><p>I’m developing with <a href=https://www.python.org/>Python</a> 3.x and <a href=http://flask.pocoo.org/>flask</a> on my fork of the <a href=https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend>systers/mentorship-backend</a> repository. You can see the latest version of the code in the <a href=https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend/tree/gsoc18-code>gsoc18-code</a> of the main repository.</p><p>These are the main extensions of <a href=http://flask.pocoo.org/>flask</a> that I used during this week:</p><ul><li><a href=http://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/>Flask-RESTPlus</a> — an extension for flask that facilitates REST APIs development. This also helped exposing <a href=https://swagger.io/>Swagger</a> documentation.</li><li><a href=https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-JWT/>Flask-JWT</a> — an extension for flask to add basic <a href=https://jwt.io/>JWT</a> features to a flask. This was used specifically for User authentication with a username and a password, then returning an access-token to login into the System.</li><li><a href=http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/>Flask-SQLAlchemy </a>— an extension for flask that adds support for <a href=http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>SQLAlchemy</a>. This allowed me to add persistence to the application, in an easy and flexible way.</li></ul><h2 id=setting-up-the-development-environment>Setting up the development environment</h2><p>I’m developing on <a href=https://www.ubuntu.com/>Ubuntu OS</a>. These are the other tools I’m using for the development:</p><ul><li><a href=https://virtualenv.pypa.io/>Virtualenv </a>— This allows the creation of isolated Python environments;</li><li><a href=https://www.getpostman.com/>Postman </a>— API Development Environment that allows me to test the REST API;</li><li><a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>PyCharm </a>— Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) by JetBrains;</li><li><a href=https://atom.io/>Atom </a>— Open source text editor by Github.</li></ul><h2 id=final-observations>Final observations</h2><p>I’m a bit late on the actual schedule since I didn’t implement the API to send an email verification yet, and I still have to finish the tests for my code. Nevertheless, I already started implementing some working items from the next weeks, such as Login and Edit profile API. Despite this, I working towards compensating the lost hours with my roadblocks and managing my time wisely.</p><p>This week has been a little stressful because of all the roadblocks, I’m very glad that I had my mentors support and understanding. This support really helps me keep calm.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright © 2022 Isabel Costa</footer></body></html>
