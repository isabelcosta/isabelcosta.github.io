I want to tell you about a <strong>contribution I have made to an open source project I used.</strong></p><p>Often I explain to people who want to start contributing, that they can look into projects they already use. This is what I did when I contributed to <a href=https://www.scala-exercises.org/>scala-exercises.org</a> website content.</p><h2 id=identifying-a-potential-contribution>Identifying a potential contribution</h2><p>I was working through <a href=https://www.scala-exercises.org/fp_in_scala>FP IN SCALA</a> exercises, from &ldquo;Functional Programming in Scala&rdquo; book, in particular, I was doing the <a href=https://www.scala-exercises.org/fp_in_scala/property_based_testing>Property Based Testing</a> section.</p><p>I noticed there was a typo where the syntax for the <a href=https://www.scala-lang.org/>scala language</a> was incorrect. Instead of showing <code>||</code>, which means logical or in Scala, it was showing <code>\\</code> that does not show correctly what it should be.</p><p>I also noticed that one of the exercises&rsquo; numbers was incorrect, in this case appearing duplicate. So instead of showing exercise <code>8.17</code> it was showing <code>8.18</code> when referring to problems from 8.17 section.</p><h2 id=looking-how-to-contribute>Looking how to contribute</h2><p>So once I found what I could improve on the website, I looked at the project&rsquo;s <a href=https://github.com/scala-exercises/exercises-fpinscala/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>contribution guidelines</a> and noticed that the process was fairly simple and there was no requirement for creating an issue before sending a pull request (PR).</p><p>So I decided to create a pull request to it, one for each change since they address different concerns.</p><p>I checked where the code I was supposed to change lived, so I could make the change. This was fairly easy because the page with the exercises had a link to the file on the respective repository that hosts the code. This was visible in an &ldquo;Edit exercises&rdquo; button at the bottom of the page, as well as a &ldquo;View on GitHub&rdquo; button on the top of the page. You can check the <a href=https://www.scala-exercises.org/fp_in_scala/property_based_testing>page I changes here</a>.</p><h2 id=contributing>Contributing</h2><p>I clicked the link, which took me to the file I need to change. At this point, I started the process of contributing. I <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo>forked the repository</a> - creating a copy of the repository on my GitHub account. Then since the changes were fairly simple, I did not have to <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository>clone the repository</a> to my development environment, I did the change using GitHub GUI (graphical user interface). There I edited the file then created the branch and committed the changes.</p><p>After changing the code, I submitted the pull requests for my changes.</p><ul><li>Fix exercise 8.9 function name from &ldquo;\&rdquo; to &ldquo;||&rdquo; => <a href=https://github.com/scala-exercises/exercises-fpinscala/pull/55>scala-exercises/exercises-fpinscala/pull/55</a></li><li>Fix wrong exercise number for Ch. 8 => <a href=https://github.com/scala-exercises/exercises-fpinscala/pull/57>scala-exercises/exercises-fpinscala/pull/57</a></li></ul><p>Eventually, one of the maintainers thanked me and merged my PRs. I also get to be in contributors mention in the page I changed :)</p><hr><p>So as you see, I fixed 2 typos that improved the content of the website. My change helped the page content be more clear, to someone using the project. I loved doing this contribution.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright Â© 2024 Isabel Costa<br>Content licensed under <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></footer></body></html>
