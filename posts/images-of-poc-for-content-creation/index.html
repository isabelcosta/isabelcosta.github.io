I found this amazing! I never thought about using my blog posts or other types of public content to spread more visual representations of people of color.</p><ul><li><a href=http://peopleofcolorintech.com/articles/where-to-find-free-stock-photos-with-people-of-color/>Where To Find Free Stock Photos With People of Color - POCIT</a></li></ul><p>After reading this, I became aware of the existence of pictures/illustrations I could use that include people of color in online content such as blogs, presentations, promotion flyers, etc. I understood I could use them as a way to increase the representation of women of color in online content, more specifically related to the Tech industry.</p><p>Since I became aware of this when I include pictures of people in my blog posts I try to always include people of color on it.</p><p>Here are three resources that I am always aware of when looking at stock photos for my blog posts:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/wocintechchat>Women of color in tech chat</a></li><li><a href=https://createherstock.com/>CreateHER Stock</a></li><li><a href=https://www.blackillustrations.com/>Illustration of Black people</a></li></ul><p>I mostly use photos from <a href=http://wocintechchat.com/>WOCinTech Chat</a>, but I always have in mind all of these resources. In fact the image from this blog post is from #WOCinTech Chat.</p><p>Thank you for reading this, I hope you find these useful and consider using these resources when appropriate.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright Â© 2022 Isabel Costa</footer></body></html>
