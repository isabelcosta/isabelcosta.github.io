I am maintaining and managing the project at the moment.</p><p>This summer I was a <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com>Google Summer of Code</a> Student with <a href=https://github.com/systers>Systers Community</a>. I proposed <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6592097335377920/>Mentorship System</a>, a mentorship application to help women in tech mentor each other, on career development topics, during a certain period of time. I worked with mentors, the Systers Open Source community.</p><p>I started with the Backend REST API development, using python and flask. After 2 months designing and implementing the backend I started implementing the Android application with Kotlin.</p><p>Repositories on GitHub:</p><ul><li>Backend application: <a href=https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-backend>anitab-org/mentorship-backend</a>;</li><li>Android application: <a href=https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-android>anitab-org/mentorship-android</a>.</li></ul><p>I documented my journey with 1 blog per week on <a href=https://medium.com/isabel-costa-gsoc>Isabel Costa GSoC Medium publication</a>.</p><p>Links: <a href>Initial GSoC Proposal</a> / <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6592097335377920/>Mentorship System on GSoC website</a> / <a href=https://medium.com/isabel-costa-gsoc>GSoC Journal on Medium</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRZrdR47R-w">Final Demo of my work</a></p><p><strong>Tech Stack and tools:</strong> Kotlin, Python, Flask, git, GitHub, SQLAlchemy, Swagger UI, Android</p><h3 id=premium---private-reactive-multipath-communication-middleware-msc-thesis>PREMIUM - Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware (MSc Thesis)</h3><p>I developed my MSc thesis &ldquo;PREMIUM: Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware&rdquo; in the context of the <a href=https://www.safecloud-project.eu/>SafeCloud</a> project, within the Distributed Systems research group of <a href=https://www.inesc-id.pt/>INESC-ID</a>. The prototype combines multipath communication and route monitoring to react to hijacking attacks.</p><p>To develop the prototype for my thesis, I worked with two previous master thesis&rsquo; projects - MACHETE, a multipath communication mechanism, and Darshana, route hijacking detection system. I refactored these projects, fixed bugs, implemented new features that were needed for my Dissertation project. I also created documentation for these.
I used the modified versions of these prototypes and implemented new modules to integrate them.</p><p>Code is available at <a href=https://github.com/inesc-id/Premium>inesc-id/Premium</a> on GitHub.</p><p><strong>Tech stack and tools:</strong> C, Java, Python, VirtualBox, Google Cloud, git, GitHub, Linux (Debian)</p><h3 id=smart-home-android-app>Smart Home Android app</h3><p>Smart Home project was developed within the Ambient Intelligence course context (from feb to may 2017). In this course I could pick any idea for the main project, as long as it was related with intelligent environments. So I decided to do an Android application suited for tablet to manage intelligent devices in a house. I wanted this application to be easy to use and accessible to people of all ages, including elderly people. So I tried to design a very simple interface so that someone could easily control home devices.</p><p>I developed planned and designed all the features. I used Model View Presenter architecture on the android app. I also implemented a very simple REST API with java.</p><p>All code and user interface designs can be found at <a href=https://github.com/isabelcosta/smart-home-project>isabelcosta/smart-home-project</a> GitHub repository.</p><p><strong>Tech Stack and tools:</strong> Java, Android, git, GitHub</p><h3 id=moviesapp>MoviesApp</h3><p>MoviesApp was the project I used to to practice my Kotlin knowledge within the Android development context. This app simply displayed movies fetched from <a href=https://developers.themoviedb.org/3>MoviesDB API</a> in a grid view (2 columns). I use Model View Presenter (MVP) architecture.</p><p>All code can be found at <a href=https://github.com/isabelcosta/MoviesApp>isabelcosta/MoviesApp</a> GitHub repository.</p><p><strong>Tech Stack and tools:</strong> Kotlin, Android, git, GitHub, Retrofit</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright Â© 2022 Isabel Costa</footer></body></html>
