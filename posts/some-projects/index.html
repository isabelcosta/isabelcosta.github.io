I&rsquo;ve maintained this open source project since summer 2018 until beginning 2022.</p><p>This summer I was a Google Summer of Code Student with <a href=https://github.com/systers>Systers Community</a> (later rebranded to <a href=https://github.com/anitab-org>AnitaB.org Open Source</a>). I proposed <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6592097335377920/>Mentorship System</a>, a mentorship application to help women in tech mentor each other, on career development topics, during a certain period of time. I worked with mentors, the Systers Open Source community.</p><p>I started with the Backend REST API development, using python and flask. After 2 months designing and implementing the backend I started implementing the Android application with Kotlin.</p><p>üíª <strong>Code</strong> on GitHub: <a href=https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-backend>anitab-org/mentorship-backend</a> and <a href=https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-android>anitab-org/mentorship-android</a></p><p>üîó <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6592097335377920/>Mentorship System on GSoC website</a> / <a href=https://medium.com/isabel-costa-gsoc>My GSoC journey on Medium</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRZrdR47R-w">Final Demo of my work</a> / <a href=/posts/introducing-mentorship-system/>Introducing Mentorship System</a></p><p>üõ†Ô∏è <strong>Tech Stack and tools:</strong> Kotlin, Python, Flask, git, GitHub, SQLAlchemy, Swagger UI, Android</p><h3 id=premium---private-reactive-multipath-communication-middleware-msc-thesis>PREMIUM - Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware (MSc Thesis)</h3><p>I developed my MSc thesis &ldquo;PREMIUM: Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware&rdquo; in the context of the <a href=https://www.safecloud-project.eu/>SafeCloud</a> project, within the Distributed Systems research group of <a href=https://www.inesc-id.pt/>INESC-ID</a>. The prototype combines multipath communication and route monitoring to react to hijacking attacks.</p><p>To develop the prototype for my thesis, I collaborated with two previous MSc thesis projects: MACHETE, a multipath communication mechanism, and Darshana, a route hijacking detection system. I refactored and updated both projects, addressing bugs and implementing new features as needed for my Dissertation project. Additionally, I thoroughly documented critical aspects of these projects and provided clear instructions for their usage.</p><p>Leveraging the modified versions of these prototypes, I developed new modules to integrate them and build a middleware capable of detecting ongoing connection path hijacks and shutting down the attack by terminating all communication paths. I also explored other solutions to address compromised paths, ensuring that the prototype was as robust and effective as possible.</p><p>üíª <strong>Code</strong> is available at <a href=https://github.com/inesc-id/Premium>inesc-id/Premium</a> on GitHub.</p><p>üõ†Ô∏è <strong>Tech stack and tools:</strong> C, Java, Python, VirtualBox, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), git, GitHub, Linux (Debian)</p><h3 id=smart-home-android-app>Smart Home Android app</h3><p>The Smart Home project was developed as part of my MSc degree coursework in Ambient Intelligence, spanning from February to May 2017. As part of the course, I was given the freedom to choose any idea related to intelligent environments for the main project. I decided to develop an Android application optimized for tablets to manage intelligent devices within a household.</p><p>My goal was to create an application that would be easy to use and accessible to people of all ages, including the elderly. To achieve this, I designed a simple interface that would allow users to easily control home devices with minimal effort.</p><p>I developed planned and designed all the features. I used Model View Presenter architecture on the android app. I also implemented a very simple REST API using java.</p><p>üíª <strong>Code</strong> and user interface designs can be found at <a href=https://github.com/isabelcosta/smart-home-project>isabelcosta/smart-home-project</a> GitHub repository.</p><p>üõ†Ô∏è <strong>Tech Stack and tools:</strong> Java, Android, git, GitHub</p><h3 id=moviesapp>MoviesApp</h3><p>MoviesApp was the project I used to to practice my Kotlin knowledge within the Android development context, back in <strong>2017</strong>. This app simply displayed movies fetched from <a href=https://developers.themoviedb.org/3>MoviesDB API</a> in a grid view (2 columns). I use Model View Presenter (MVP) architecture.</p><p>üíª <strong>Code</strong> can be found at <a href=https://github.com/isabelcosta/MoviesApp>isabelcosta/MoviesApp</a> GitHub repository.</p><p>üõ†Ô∏è <strong>Tech Stack and tools:</strong> Kotlin, Android, git, GitHub, Retrofit</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright ¬© 2024 Isabel Costa<br>Content licensed under <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></footer></body></html>
