Hope this helps other newbies at blogging!</p><p>I was inspired to share this because of the <a href=https://2018.codenewbie.org/>#CNC2018</a> Blog More challenge from <a href=https://www.codenewbie.org/>CodeNewbie</a>.</p><h4 id=una-kravets>Una Kravets</h4><p>What <a href=https://medium.com/u/a6dfab4de95e>Una Kravets</a> say here really resonates with me because when I took notes at school, I really would come to appreciate it during the phase of exams and tests.</p><h4 id=craig-russell>Craig Russell</h4><p>I really needed to see this tweet! At first, I would get really concerned if an idea I had for a post was already out there on the internet. That would really make me give up writing the blog post. Despite my feeling, when I look at this thread I feel much better, because what <a href=https://medium.com/u/e70c655d45e1>Craig Russell</a> says makes sense to me.</p><p>Highlighted sub tweets:</p><h4 id=shubheksha>Shubheksha</h4><p>This is an awesome thread about the insecurity of having to know everything, and the reach for the perfect blog post, that can cause you to never publish a drafted post. <a href=https://medium.com/u/c98f56800747>Shubheksha</a> gets really candid about this and really helps me to overcome the fear of publishing posts.</p><p>Highlighted sub tweets:</p><h4 id=christina-lee>Christina Lee</h4><p>This one reminds me that you can learn a lot from blogging, the research for the blog post topic, and the willingness to have a good blog post makes you learn more about the topic. As <a href=https://medium.com/u/72bd5082d8aa>Christina Lee</a> says, this also applies for public speaking.</p><hr><p>For now this are the tweets that I saved regarding blogging motivation. If I see others that might help, I’ll add here.</p><p>Share this with anyone that might be one motivational tweet away of starting or blog more.</p><p><em>The picture in this post is from the awesome initiative <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/wocintechchat/>#WOCinTech Chat photos</a> — <a href=http://wocnintechchat.com>wocnintechchat.com</a></em></p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright © 2022 Isabel Costa</footer></body></html>
